# pythoncode

A collection of small Python practice programs and exercises. This repository contains example scripts for file handling, recursion, data structures, and other learning exercises.

How to run the file handling example:

1. From PowerShell, run:

```
& C:/Users/Shashank/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python313/python.exe c:/Users/Shashank/OneDrive/Desktop/pythoncode/filehandling/01filehandling.py
```

2. If `sample.txt` is missing, create it at `filehandling/sample.txt` or run the script from the `filehandling` folder.
